/**
 * Real per-model export implementations for the Export Changes flow, plus the
 * production `BuildArtifactsDeps` wiring. Kept out of `model-changes.ts` so that
 * module (and its unit tests) stay free of the browser renderer and the store
 * barrel — the pure `buildChangedArtifacts` takes these as injected deps.
 *
 * Both paths bake the model's pending edits (`applyMutations: true`,
 * `includeGeometry: true`) so the output is a full, round-trippable model with
 * changes applied — not a delta. The STEP path additionally splices any pending
 * schedule, but ONLY when handed real schedule state (the caller passes `null`
 * for every non-target model), which is the sole guard against injecting the
 * single global schedule into every exported file.
