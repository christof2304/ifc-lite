/**
 * Branching (spec §12.4 — v0.7 starter).
 *
 * `forkSession(parent, opts)` — snapshot the parent Y.Doc, seed a new
 * Y.Doc with the snapshot, and wrap it as a fresh `CollabSession`. The
 * branch carries `meta.parentRoomId` + `meta.branchName` for round-trip
 * tooling.
 *
 * `mergeBranch(parent, branch, strategy)` — bring the branch's edits
 * back. Two strategies ship in v0.7:
 *   - `'ops'`   : encode the branch's full state as a Y update and
 *                 `applyUpdate` it into the parent. Works for any pair
 *                 of CRDT docs; concurrent parent edits LWW-merge with
 *                 the branch's edits per Yjs semantics.
 *   - `'layer'` : extract the branch contents as an IFCX layer and
 *                 apply it over the parent as a layer of opinions.
 *                 Useful when the branch was edited by tools that only
 *                 speak IFCX, not the live Y.Doc.
 *
 * The proper differential layer composer lands later in v0.7 — for now
 * `'layer'` produces a snapshot-of-branch layer, which is the same
 * trade-off documented in `snapshot/layers.ts`.
